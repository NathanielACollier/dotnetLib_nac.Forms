# Reactive Readme
+ Code in this folder was original taken from other locations as desribed below
+ Used [this github search](https://github.com/search?q=class+Subject%3CT%3E+%3A+IObservable%3CT%3E&type=code)
+ I originally found this version of [Subject](https://github.com/morelinq/MoreLINQ/blob/35fefdfffe5024b4ee5286a234c68204ac5382ce/MoreLinq/Reactive/Subject.cs#L24)
	+ It was licensed under the `Apache License version=2`
+ Then later I found a [simpler version of Subject](https://github.com/aardvark-platform/aardvark.base/blob/7a635f1c6c8675a4ec3113b9e9643c4c77b27bba/src/Aardvark.Base.Essentials/System/Reactive.cs), that I further reduced by removing the locks
	+ This was also licensed under `Apache License version=2`
